Turtle Crossing Game
This project is a Python-based game developed as part of the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp. It is inspired by the classic arcade game Frogger, where the player controls a turtle attempting to cross a road filled with moving vehicles.

Features:
  Player control: The player can move the turtle character vertically using the keyboard.
  Vehicle movement: Cars and trucks move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds.
  Levels: The difficulty increases as the player successfully crosses the road and progresses to higher levels. The vehicles move faster with each new level.
  Game over condition: If the turtle collides with a vehicle, the game ends, and the player must restart.
Technologies Used:
  Python 3
  Turtle graphics: Used for rendering the game characters (turtle, cars, and trucks) and game environment.
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is structured using classes to handle elements like the turtle, vehicles, and levels.
How to Play:
  Use the up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
  Avoid the cars and trucks moving across the screen.
  Reach the top of the screen to level up, increasing the difficulty.
  If the turtle is hit by a vehicle, the game is over.
Future Improvements:
  Add sound effects for vehicle collisions and level completions.
  Implement more challenging levels with different obstacles and vehicle patterns.
  Introduce a scoring system to track the playerâ€™s progress over time.
